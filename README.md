# html-resume-project
<h1><b>An extremely basic resume/portfolio-type website design</b></h1>
<br>
<p>A Multipage site created by using only HTML,I created this when I was learning the basics of HTML.</p>
<ul>
  <li>HTML boiler plate has been used to generate the overall structure</li>
  <li>Three heading styles (h1-h3) have been used to define the headings</li>
  <li>A picture of height 200 has been put up by using img tag</li>
  <li>Multiple hr(horizontal rule) tags have been used to sperate the site into multiple sections along with a wide use of ul(unordered list) tags to create bullet points</li>
  <li>Anchor link tags have been used to offer multipage functionalities</li>
  <li>At last footer tags have been used to display some copyright messages at the footer end of the website</li>
</ul>
<p>This project covers almost all the basic structuring implementations of html.</p>
