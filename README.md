# html-resume-project
<h1><b>An extremely basic resume/portfolio-type website design</b></h1>
<br>
<p>A Multipage site created by using only HTML, I had created this when I was learning about the basics of HTML.</p>
<ul>
  <li>HTML boiler plate has been used to generate the overall structure.</li>
  <li>Three heading styles (h1-h3) have been used to define the headings.</li>
  <li>A picture of height 200 has been put up by using img tag.</li>
  <li>Hr(horizontal rule) tags have been used to seperate the site into multiple sections along with a wide usage of ul(unordered list) tags to create unordered lists with bullet points.</li>
  <li>Multipage funcationalities have been provided by using anchor tags with 'href' attribute.</li>
  <li>At last, footer tags have been used to display some copyright messages at the footer end of the website.</li>
</ul>
<p>This example project covers almost all the basic structuring implementations of html.</p>
